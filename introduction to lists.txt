INTRODUCTION TO LISTS 
list is an abstract data type 
it uses list interface 
there are many list calsses but specifically here we will talk about the 
-array list
-linked list
-vector
-abstract list
methods we are going to use here are the
-add
-contain 
-get
-indexof
-remove
-find
-toarray

here we work on ordered sequence (data is organised in sequence)


ABSTRACT DATATYPE:

- doesn't dicatede how the data is organized
- dictates the operations your perfrom 
- concerete data structure is usually a concerete calss
- abstract data type is usually an interface
- arrays have a proper orders and concerete infromation about the data but list 
is an conceptual idea and didictae the operation which we can perfrom on data 
(how can we access the items)
- abtract data type is more of behaviours
- any data structure can be used to implement abstract data type until we have a class
