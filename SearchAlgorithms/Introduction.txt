SEARCH ALGORITHMS 
INTRODUCTION
Searching algorithms are essential tools in computer science used to locate specific
items within a collection of data. These algorithms are designed to efficiently 
navigate through data structures to find the desired information, making them 
fundamental in various applications such as databases, web search engines, and more.

Terminologies
1. Target Element: The specific target element or items that we want to find within a 
collection of data that can be in form of any datastructure.
2. Search Space: the entire collection of data within hich we are looking for the target 
element or item 

It will find a  value in a data structure 

Deterministic: algorithms which follow a clear, systematic apprach
one such example is linear seach 
non-Deterministic : Algorithms which needs to examine the enitre spcae in the worst case 
scenario.
