SINGLY LINKED LIST


Singly linked list or local list 
it is a  data structure a sequenctial list of objects without 
the usage of array 
each items in a list is aware of next time as they are linked to each other 
which is not there in arrays

here we have to store the integre value a;ong with the reference value

each item in the list is called a node
the first items in the list is the head of the list and last the items points to the null

each node contain integer or infromation and then a node that reference node which point to the
next items 

Here the developer need to put the head items and the it traerse itself until reaches the null

how can we insert and items to the head node in a list
we have a example of link list in which we add the head node

Jane->John->Mary->Mike->null


1. Create a new node "Bill"
2. Assign "Jane" to the next field
3. Assign head to "Bill"
4. Will be O(1) time complexity 

In the list we insert any new items we add it at the first node or head node
and this phenomena will give constant time complexity 

and this will be the update linked list 

Bill->Jane->John->Mary->Mike->null


Delete the item 
and this will also done on the first node 
 
Bill->Jane->John->Mary->Mike->null

Delete

this is the linked list and now steps to remove the item 

1. Assign 'Bill" to a temporary varibale "removedNode"
2. Assign "head" to "Jane"
3. Return "removedNode"
4. Will be O(1) time complexity


the updated list will look like

Jane->John->Mary->Mike->null
