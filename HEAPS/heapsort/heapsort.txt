HEAP SORT 
- we know that root is the largest value 
- swap root witht the last element in th arrays
- heapify the tree, but exclude the last node
- after heapify , second largest element at the root
- rinse and repeat 
 


 so this is the heap we will work on

 80, 75, 60, 68, 55, 40, 52, 67
 lastheapIndex=7
 swap heap[0] with the [lastHeapIndex]

 67, 75, 60, 68, 55, 40, 52, 80
it is not a heap so heapify by looking dow the tree

lastHeapIndex=6
 swap heap[0] with the [lastHeapIndex]

  68, 67, 60, 52, 55, 40, 75, 80
it is not a heap so heapify by looking dow the tree

lastHeapIndex=5
 swap heap[0] with the [lastHeapIndex]

  40, 67, 60, 52, 55, 68, 75, 80
it is not a heap so heapify by looking dow the tree

lastHeapIndex=4
 swap heap[0] with the [lastHeapIndex]

  40, 67, 60, 52, 55, 68, 75, 80
it is not a heap so heapify by looking dow the tree

and continue
