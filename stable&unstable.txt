Stable Vs Unstable sorts

This concept comes into play when array have duplicate values
for example
[5, 9, 3, 9, 8, 4]
This will create a issue that where these duplicates items will be placed 

if sort is unstbal then the relatives of dubolicate items will not be preserved

The 9 are sorted but the relative ordering is not preserved and they will swap the values 


Stable sort are the the relative ordering of the duplicate otems have been preserved as their idexs will be as per 
the original index the elment which comes at index first will be placed at first and then the second duplictae item.

lets talk about the bubble sort is it a stable sort or unstable sort
in bubble sort the algorithm the swaping of elements will define the stablitiy
of the sort as it the swaping is done based on greater than and equal to or equal then or greater than

Greater then equal then we need to perform the swap that will flip the 
relative index values of the duplicate elements and gets a unstable sort.
