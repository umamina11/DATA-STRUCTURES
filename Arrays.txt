Arrays 

Defination: Array is a collection of items sorted at a contiguous ( together in a sequence) memory location.
The idea is to store multiple items of the same type together. This makes it easier to calculate the position of each element by simply adding an offset to a base value.

BASIC termonologies:
Array index: the elements position or elements are identified by their indexes. 
            All index values start from 0 
Array Element: The values in the array that are sorted and can be assessed by the provided index values.
Array Length: The length is defiend by the items/ elements contained in the array.

SYNTAX
DATATYPE NAME_OF_ARRAY [Elemnent];
or
DATATYPE NAME_OF_ARRAY[SIZE]={ELEMENT 1, ELEMENT 2,..............};

NEED FOR DATA STRUCTURES

To represent the many instances under just in a varibale name.
Effiecient access to the element
It allow the fast data retrival 

****BIG-O Notation*****

the running time of the program of code depends on differnt factors 
developers need more a more objective measure other than the running time for working effeciently, so the 
deveopler took number of steps involved in running a algorithm irrespective of 
of harware or software used, called time complexity 
These are of two types one is the time complexity which involves the number steps involved to run an algorithm and 
memory complexity which is the memeory used to run an algorithm. 
But as for now memory is not such an big issues as it is available cheaply to everyone
without any hasel so, time complexity is given more priority
