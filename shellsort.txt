Shell Sort:

It is a variation of insertion Sort
insertion sort chooses which element to insert using a gap of 1
Shell short starts out using a larger gap value 
AS the algorithm runs, the gap is reduced 
goal is to reduce the amount of shifting required
As the algorithm progresses, the gap is reduced 
the last gap value is always 1
a gap value of 1 is equivalent to insertion sort
so the algorithm does some preliminary work (using the gap values greater yhan 1),
and then becomes the insertion sort
By the time we get to insertion sort the arry has been partially sorted, so there's less shifting
required


Shell sort is mainly a variation of Insertion Sort. In insertion sort,
we move elements only one position ahead.
When an element has to be moved far ahead, many movements 
are involved. The idea of ShellSort is to allow the exchange of far items.
In Shell sort, we make the array h-sorted for a large value of h. We keep
reducing the value of h until it becomes 1. An array is said to be 
h-sorted if all sublists of every h’th element are sorted.

Time Complexity: Time complexity of the above implementation of Shell sort is O(n2). In the above implementation, the gap is reduced by half in every iteration. There are many other ways to reduce gaps which leads to better time complexity. See this for more details.

Worst Case Complexity
The worst-case complexity for shell sort is  O(n2)
Best Case Complexity
When the given array list is already sorted the total count of comparisons of each interval is equal to the size of the given array.
So best case complexity is Ω(n log(n))
Average Case Complexity

The shell sort Average Case Complexity depends on the interval selected by the programmer. 
θ(n log(n)2).

THE Average Case Complexity: O(n*log n)~O(n1.25)
Space Complexity
The space complexity of the shell sort is O(1).


Knuth Sequence 
K               Gap (interval)
1               1
2               4
3               13
4               40
5               121

Here the gap is calculated using the formula (3^k-1)/2
We set k based on the length of the array
We want the gap to be as close as possible to the length of the array
we want to sort, without being greater than the length

Lets take an array 
20, 35, -15, 7, 55, 1, -22
we will base our gap on the array's length. We will initialize the gap(or interval)
to array.length/2
on each iterations, we will divide the gap value by 2 to get the next gap value
For our array, the gap will be initialize to 3
on the next iteration, it will be 1- insertion sort

20, 35, -15, 7, 55, 1, -22

i = gap = 3 
j = i = 3
newelement = intarr[i] = 7
compare intarr[ j - gap ] with newelement
as clearly observed that 7 is smaller than 20 so 
they will swap the values 
updated array will be 

7, 35, -15, 20, 55, 1, -22

i = gap = 3
j = j - gap = 0
newelement = intarr[i] = 7


next step 
i = 4
j = i = 4
newelement = intarr[i] = 55

compare int aa[j-gap] with newelement

as 55 > 35 so no change the array will remain same 

i = 5
j = i = 5
newelement = intarr[i] = 1
compare intarr[j - gap] wiht new element
no change as -15< 1 

now i = 6
j = i = 6
newelement =  intarr[i]=-22
compare int arr[j-gap] with new element
 updated array will be 
 -22 , 35 , -15 , 7 , 55 , 1 , 20


 we have compeleted the iteration with gap =3 
 now the array is somewhat sortedwe have moved -22 
 to the front of the array. we have also moved 20 closer to 
 its sorted position, 
  now we update the gap (gap/1) the gap will become 1, we are switiching to insertion sort

  Shell sort is an in-place algorithm
  difficult to nail down the time complexity because its will dependson the gap
  worst case: O(n^2), but it can perfrom much better than this
  doesnt require as much as shifting as insertion sort, so it usually perfroms better 
  this is an unstbale algorithm
