It is a divide and conquer algorithm becuase it involves splitting the array 
that need to be sorted into bunch of smaller array
Usually implemented using recursion method
It invloves two major phases
- splitting
- merging
splitting phase leads to faster, sorting during the merging phase
perfrom the sorting during merging pahse and prepartaion is done at splitting phase
Splitting is logical, we dont create new arrays

SPLITTING PHASE 
start with the unsorted array and divide them into the two parts which are unsorted
the first array is the left array and the second array is the right array 
split the left and right arrays into two arrays each 
and this process of splitting goes on until each array have one element in it.

IF the number of elements are odd in array then it depend on implmenetaion and put elements in left and right
arrays 

The last array after complete sepration we have sorted array by default as it contain one element only.

MERGING PHASE

Merge every left/rught pari of siblings array into sorted array.
after the first merge, we will have to bunch of 2-element aorted arrays
then merge those sorted array (Left/Right Siblings) to end up with a bunch 
of 4 element sorted array
Repeat until we get a single sorted array
Not in-place, use temporary arrays.
