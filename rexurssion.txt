Recusrion is calling itself 
example 
factorial of any number
4!= 4*3*2*1
Exception 0 whose factorial is 1

the algorithm for finding factorial
step 1: If num is equal to 0, then the result will be 1 and stop this is the result
Step 2: set multipler to 1
step 3: set factorial to 1
step 4: while multipler is not equal to num, do step 5 and 6
step 5: multiply factorial by multipler and assign the result to factorial 
Step 6: add 1 to multipler
step 7: stop the result is the factorial
