Recusrion is calling itself 
Recursion means "defining a problem in terms of itself". This can be a 
very powerful tool in writing algorithms. Recursion comes directly from 
Mathematics, where there are many examples of expressions written in terms 
of themselves. 
For example, the Fibonacci sequence is defined as: F(i) = F(i-1) + F(i-2)
in recursion when we dont have a breakin condition then it get stack overflow 
error also soemthimes it happen when there is break in cidntion, but somewhere it
cause some recursive calling again and again which cause stack overflow
example 
factorial of any number

4!= 4*3*2*1
Exception 0 whose factorial is 1

the algorithm for finding factorial
step 1: If num is equal to 0, then the result will be 1 and stop this is the result
Step 2: set multipler to 1
step 3: set factorial to 1
step 4: while multipler is not equal to num, do step 5 and 6
step 5: multiply factorial by multipler and assign the result to factorial 
Step 6: add 1 to multipler
step 7: stop the result is the factorial
