VECTORS

A vector is a one-dimensional data structure and all of its elements 
are of the same data type.
A factor is one-dimensional and every element must be one of a 
fixed set of values, called the levels of the factor.

it is a thread safe list implementation
it is very old and have been there when jdk 1.0 exists
vectors are synchronised whereas arraylist not
synchronisation makes the process slow thats why array list are not synchronisation
