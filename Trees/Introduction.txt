TREES

Trees to diticate how to organise the data and also by operatioons of data that's why the confusion 
is still there that it is a abstract dataype or datastructures

If someone asked what is a tree 
as in real work it has brances, leavses here also 

TREE is a hierarchical data structure 
                  15   ------------>Root
                /  |  \------------>Edge (arrow)
              22   4   17
            /    / | \  | \
           19   9  18 3 11 0   ----> Leaf

Every element is called as node 
Node have children(0, one, or more)
Every node/child has one parent 
The top most node is called the root, above which there is no parent (15)
Every tree has only one and only one node
Leaf node are the one who dont have any further child (19, 9, 18, 3, 11, 0)
Subtree is a node along with all its descendends.
Path a sequence of nodes require to reach a element node
no cycles are required in paths, it's alway one way 
Depth is the number of edges required to reach the element , straight and shortest
Height: the number of edges requied to the elment node and for calacuating this the 
longest path edges are calculated.
Example here the height of tree is 3 
leaf node height is always 0
height of root node= height of tree
Siblings : have same or one parent and same level
Depth= height


 application
 java class
 file or folder in system 

 Every item in the tree is a node
 The node at the top of the tree is the root 
 Every non-root node has one and only one parent 
 A leaf node has no children
 A signleton tree has only one node - the root
