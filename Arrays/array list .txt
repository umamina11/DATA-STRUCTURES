ARRAY LISTS
ArrayList is a Java class implemented using the List interface. 
Java ArrayList, as the name suggests, provides the functionality of a 
dynamic array where the size is not fixed as an array. Also, as a part 
of the Collection framework, it has many features not available with
arrays.
The ArrayList class is a resizable array, which can be found in the 
java.util package.

The difference between a built-in array and an ArrayList in Java, 
is that the size of an array cannot be modified (if you want to add or
remove elements to/from an array, you have to create a new one).


it is a resizable array implementaion oof the list interface and called backing array 
it is great with iteration implementaion 
to add items ot the array then it will be the slow and reduce the overall perfromace when 
adding and removing of items in array list will be slow


in array list we listen to two words and need to understand the differenrce between then 
those are 
capacity and size
capacity is the maximum number of elements it can hold before it need to be resized

size is the the maximum number of elements present in array list
